#Object Creation and Functions Practice Activity

This repo was created to practice creating objects using both literal and constructor functions.

The teams described in the exercise are both fictional, based on not having enough data from other teams.

The output for the scripts should look like the following:

```The Minneapolis Marauders is a Joggling team from Minneapolis that was established in 2000.  The 500 players practice at Lake Nokomis Park and compete in US Joggling competitions.  They have achieved third place in Division in 2003 under the previous coach Nick Fury, and second place Overall in 2007 under the current coach Peggy Carter.

The Kansas Kapitals team is great!
